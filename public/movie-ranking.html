<h1>Minti's Favourite movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1)Whiplash</h3>
<br>I like the plot and how the protagonish deals with depression and 
how it is depicted through the script that being persistent can prove to be rewarding regardless of how many failure and setbacks one recieves.<br>

<h3>2)Kung fu panda</h3>
<br>In this trilogy we see the journey of Poo who is a misfit in the world of Kung Fu, we see how he discovers his true potential and comes to realize that Kung-fu isn't something he has to embody but in contrary it's an integral part of his persona and weather he realises this or not but he is the only one worthy enough to be a hero regardess of how he percieves himself and how people persive him<br>

<h3>3) The boy, the fox, the mole and the horse</h3>
<br>It is a 30 min long short movie that adresses serious topics like loneliness and low self esteem in a delicate yet admiring way, I mainly like the dialogues and metaphorism of this movie be it the fact that Horse can fly but he stopped because it would make other horses jealous or the fact that the little boy is afraid but his fear is reduced when he sees that others around him are also afraid. <br>
